Nonlinear Control Examples for a 2-link Robotic Arm

The systems's dynamics of a 2-DOF Robot manipulator was cite from the paper:
Shah, Jolly, S. S. Rattan, and B. C. Nakra. "Dynamic analysis of two link robot manipulator for control design using computed torque control." International Journal of Research in Computer Applications and Robotics 3.1 (2015): 52-59.

Using the dynamics, adaptive, observer, output feedback and robust controllers are designed and simulated via Simulink
